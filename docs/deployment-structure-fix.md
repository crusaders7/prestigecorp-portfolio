# Deployment Directory Structure Fixed ✅

## Issue Resolved

The deployment was failing because Vercel was looking for files in a specific directory structure that didn't exist:
- Expected: `projects/newspaperscraper/` directory with deployment files
- Actual: Files were in `fresh-news-deployment/` directory

Additionally, there was a configuration conflict in vercel.json with both `builds` and `functions` properties.

## Solution Applied

1. **Created the missing directory structure**:
   - Created `projects/` directory
   - Created `projects/newspaperscraper/` directory
   - Copied all deployment files from `fresh-news-deployment/` to `projects/newspaperscraper/`

2. **Fixed Vercel configuration conflict**:
   - Removed conflicting `builds` property from vercel.json
   - Kept only the `functions` property as recommended by Vercel

## Current Directory Structure

```
projects/
└── newspaperscraper/
    ├── index.html
    ├── vercel.json
    ├── requirements.txt
    ├── api/
    │   ├── search.py
    │   ├── scrape.py
    │   ├── download.py
    │   ├── protected_cse.py
    │   └── __init__.py
    └── [other files]
```

## Files Verified

All required files are now in place:
- ✅ index.html (frontend interface)
- ✅ vercel.json (corrected configuration)
- ✅ requirements.txt (dependencies)
- ✅ api/search.py (Google CSE implementation)
- ✅ api/scrape.py (content extraction)
- ✅ api/download.py (export functionality)

## Configuration Fixes

### vercel.json (Fixed)
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "functions": {
    "api/*.py": {
      "runtime": "python3.9"
    }
  },
  "env": {
    "GOOGLE_API_KEY": "@google_api_key",
    "GOOGLE_CSE_ID": "@google_cse_id"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Update Vercel Project Settings**:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard
   - Find the news.prestigecorp.au project
   - Settings → General → Root Directory
   - Change from '.' to 'projects/newspaperscraper'
   - Save and redeploy

2. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Make sure GOOGLE_API_KEY and GOOGLE_CSE_ID are set in Vercel

3. **Deploy**:
   - Push changes to repository
   - Monitor deployment logs

The fresh-news-deployment application should now deploy successfully with all functionality intact.
