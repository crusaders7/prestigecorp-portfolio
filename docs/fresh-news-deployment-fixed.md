# Fresh-News Deployment - Fixed and Ready ✅

## Issue Resolved

The deployment was failing with the error: "The specified Root Directory 'fresh-news-deployment' does not exist."

**Fix Applied**: Renamed the directory from `news-scraper-deployment` to `fresh-news-deployment` to match Vercel's expected root directory.

## Current Status

✅ **Ready for Deployment**

The fresh-news-deployment application has been fixed and is now ready for Vercel deployment.

## Directory Structure

```
fresh-news-deployment/
├── index.html
├── vercel.json
├── requirements.txt
├── api/
│   ├── search.py
│   ├── scrape.py
│   ├── download.py
│   ├── protected_cse.py
│   └── __init__.py
└── [other files]
```

## Components Verified

1. **Frontend**:
   - index.html with complete JavaScript functionality
   - Proper API integration with search, scrape, and download features

2. **Backend API**:
   - Search endpoint (api/search.py) - Google CSE integration
   - Scrape endpoint (api/scrape.py) - BeautifulSoup content extraction
   - Download endpoint (api/download.py) - JSON/ZIP export

3. **Configuration**:
   - vercel.json - Proper Vercel deployment configuration
   - requirements.txt - All necessary Python dependencies

## Vercel Configuration

The vercel.json file is properly configured with:
- Correct builds configuration for Python API endpoints
- Proper routes mapping for API and frontend
- Functions runtime specification
- Environment variable placeholders

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Commit and Push Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix deployment directory structure for fresh-news"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Verify Vercel Settings**:
   - Ensure Vercel project root directory is set to "fresh-news-deployment"
   - Set the required environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
     - `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - Your Google API key
     - `GOOGLE_CSE_ID` - Your Google Custom Search Engine ID

3. **Deploy**:
   - Vercel should automatically deploy after pushing changes
   - Monitor the deployment logs for any issues

## Expected Outcome

After deployment, the application should be accessible at your configured domain (likely https://news.prestigecorp.au) with full functionality:

1. **Search**: Find news articles using Google CSE
2. **Scrape**: Extract full article content
3. **Download**: Export articles in JSON or ZIP format

The application is now properly structured and ready for successful deployment on Vercel.
