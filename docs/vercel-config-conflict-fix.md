# Vercel Configuration Conflict Fixed ✅

## Issue Resolved

**Error Message**: "Conflicting functions and builds configuration - There are two ways to configure Vercel functions in your project: functions or builds. However, only one of them may be used at a time - they cannot be used in conjunction."

## Problem Analysis

The [vercel.json](file:///c%3A/Users/prestigecorp-portfolio/apps/fresh-news/vercel.json) file contained both `builds` and `functions` properties, which is not allowed in Vercel configuration. According to Vercel's documentation, only one of these properties can be used at a time.

## Solution Applied

I've updated the [vercel.json](file:///c%3A/Users/prestigecorp-portfolio/apps/fresh-news/vercel.json) file to use only the `functions` property as recommended, since it provides more advanced features:

1. **Removed** the conflicting `builds` property
2. **Kept** the `functions` property with proper configuration
3. **Maintained** all other necessary configurations (routes, environment variables)

## Updated Configuration

### Before (Incorrect):
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "api/*.py",
      "use": "@vercel/python"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [...],
  "functions": {
    "api/*.py": {
      "runtime": "python3.9"
    }
  },
  "env": {...}
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "functions": {
    "api/*.py": {
      "runtime": "python3.9"
    }
  },
  "env": {
    "GOOGLE_API_KEY": "@google_api_key",
    "GOOGLE_CSE_ID": "@google_cse_id"
  }
}
```

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Eliminates Configuration Conflict**: Resolves the deployment error
2. **Enables Advanced Features**: The `functions` property allows:
   - Configuration of memory allocation for Vercel Functions
   - More reliable runtime specification
   - Support for "clean URLs" (accessible without file extensions)
3. **Maintains Functionality**: All existing features remain intact

## Verification

The configuration has been verified to ensure:
- ✅ No conflicting `builds` property
- ✅ Proper `functions` property with Python 3.9 runtime
- ✅ Correct routes configuration for API and frontend
- ✅ Required environment variables preserved

## Next Steps

1. Commit and push the changes to your repository
2. The deployment should now proceed without the configuration conflict error
3. Monitor the deployment logs to ensure everything works correctly

The fresh-news-deployment application should now deploy successfully on Vercel with all functionality intact.
