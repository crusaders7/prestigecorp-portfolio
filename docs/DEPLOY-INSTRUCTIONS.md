# Deploy Instructions for Updated Portfolio

## Current Issue
The portfolio is not showing the Universal News Scraper project. The local files have been updated but need to be pushed to GitHub.

## Quick Fix Options:

### Option 1: Manual Git Push (Recommended)
1. Navigate to your portfolio directory
2. Run these commands:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Universal News Scraper to portfolio"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Manual File Replacement
Replace the contents of your `index.html` file with the updated version (see index.html in this directory).

## What the Update Includes:
- ✅ New portfolio design with Universal News Scraper featured prominently
- ✅ Professional project description without specific site mentions
- ✅ Live Demo button linking to: https://news-scraper-vercel-4zu8nqnxi-prestigecorp4s-projects.vercel.app
- ✅ GitHub link for the project
- ✅ Technology badges and features list
- ✅ Modern responsive design with animations

## Expected Result:
After deployment, your portfolio will show the Universal News Scraper as the main featured project with working links to the live demo.

Current status: Changes committed locally, need to push to GitHub for deployment.
