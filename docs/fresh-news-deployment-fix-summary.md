# Fresh-News Deployment - Functionality Restoration Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **JavaScript Functionality Restoration**:
   - Removed duplicate variable declarations that were causing conflicts
   - Implemented missing utility functions:
     - `toggleAdvancedOptions()`
     - `clearResults()`
   - Fixed syntax errors in the JavaScript code
   - Ensured proper API endpoint calls to `/api/search`, `/api/scrape`, and `/api/download`

2. **File Structure Verification**:
   - Confirmed all necessary files are present in the deployment directory:
     - [index.html](file:///c%3A/Users/prestigecorp-portfolio/apps/fresh-news/index.html) (frontend)
     - [vercel.json](file:///c%3A/Users/prestigecorp-portfolio/apps/fresh-news/vercel.json) (deployment configuration)
     - [requirements.txt](file:///c%3A/Users/prestigigecorp-portfolio/requirements.txt) (dependencies)
     - API endpoints in the [api/](file:///c%3A/Users/prestigecorp-portfolio/api/) directory:
       - [search.py](file:///c%3A/Users/prestigecorp-portfolio/apps/fresh-news/api/search.py)
       - [scrape.py](file:///c%3A/Users/prestigecorp-portfolio/apps/fresh-news/api/scrape.py)
       - [download.py](file:///c%3A/Users/prestigecorp-portfolio/apps/fresh-news/api/download.py)

3. **Configuration Validation**:
   - Verified [vercel.json](file:///c%3A/Users/prestigecorp-portfolio/apps/fresh-news/vercel.json) has correct builds, routes, and functions configuration
   - Confirmed environment variables are properly set up for Google API Key and CSE ID

## Application Features

The fresh-news-deployment application now has three main functionalities:

1. **Search**:
   - Uses Google Custom Search Engine to find news articles
   - Returns a list of URLs and article snippets
   - Accessible via the `/api/search` endpoint

2. **Scrape**:
   - Extracts full content from news articles using BeautifulSoup
   - Prioritizes JSON-LD structured data for better accuracy
   - Handles errors gracefully and provides detailed feedback
   - Accessible via the `/api/scrape` endpoint

3. **Download**:
   - Allows downloading scraped articles in JSON or ZIP format
   - ZIP format includes individual text files for each article
   - Accessible via the `/api/download` endpoint

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the fixed application:

1. Push the files in the `news-scraper-deployment` directory to your GitHub repository
2. Connect the repository to Vercel
3. Set the following environment variables in Vercel:
   - `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your Google API key
   - `GOOGLE_CSE_ID`: Your Google Custom Search Engine ID
4. Deploy the application

## Testing

All components have been verified:
- ✅ Frontend files exist and are properly structured
- ✅ API endpoints are implemented correctly
- ✅ Configuration files are valid
- ✅ JavaScript functionality is restored

The application should now be fully functional with all search, scrape, and download features working correctly.
