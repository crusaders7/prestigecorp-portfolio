    # Key findings from the logs
    print('🔍 KEY DISCOVERIES:')
    print('1. ✅ Deployment IS working - Status 200 responses!')
    print('2. ❌ Using OLD search algorithm, NOT Google CSE')
    print('3. 🔧 Function is using web scraping, not our new API')

    print('\n📋 LOG EVIDENCE:')
    print('• "Searching Illawarra Mercury for \'shellharbour council\'..."')
    print('• "Strategy 1 found 2-4 relevant articles"')
    print('• "Found 106 total articles from categories"')
    print('• "DuckDuckGo search found 0 total articles"')
    print('• "Google search found 0 articles"')

    print('\n🚨 CRITICAL INSIGHT:')
    print('The deployment is NOT failing!')
    print('Vercel is successfully running an OLD VERSION of the code')
    print('that uses web scraping instead of Google CSE API!')

    print('\n💡 WHAT THIS MEANS:')
    print('• Vercel has cached/deployed an older version')
    print('• The function works (200 status) but uses wrong algorithm')
    print('• Our Google CSE code is not being executed')
    print(
        '• This explains the old response format: [\'query\', \'found\', \'urls\', \'sources_searched\']')

    print('\n🎯 ROOT CAUSE:')
    print('Vercel is serving a cached version from a different deployment')
    print('or the build process is not picking up our latest files!')

    print('\n🛠️ SOLUTIONS TO TRY:')
    print('1. Force complete cache clear in Vercel dashboard')
    print('2. Delete and redeploy the entire project')
    print('3. Check if files are in wrong directory structure')
    print('4. Verify which commit Vercel is actually building')
